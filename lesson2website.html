	<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black; color:black">Hacksaw Ridge, Best movie of 2016! In my opinion, of all time! The movie is about a man who joins the army for the Battle of Okinawa in World War 2. But his religion prohibits him from using a gun or from killing someone. I originally went to see this movie because I was a christian and it sounded like an inspiring story. There is no flaw in this movie. It is one of Mel Gibson's best and I definitely reccomend you guys seeing it.

	<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black; color:black">The Lego Batman Movie, a great movie for everyone! This movie had me laughing so much. Will Arnett and Michael Cera make great picks for the characters and really make you have a connection with them. There is one bad thing about this movie is that the joker isn't the best. He didn't really make a great performance for everyone to see. But other than that I totally reccomend this movie. Definitely go see it!</h4>

	<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black; color:black">The new M. Night Shyamalan movie about a man with a disorder of multiple personalities. This movie was a very interesting and great piece by Shyamalan. I thought this movie gave us a edge of your seat moment that was very enjoyable. It was also very funny and James McAvoy did an amazing job as our main character especially with different roles he was playing. Definitely go see it!</h4>

	<h4 style="font-family:Arial Black; color:black">Ant-Man, now my favorite marvel movie ever made! I really didn't have high expectations going into this and after i was blown away. This movie is amazing and the cast does an amazing job playing their parts. I don't think you can have a more better person for Ant-Man than Paul Rudd. This movie had a great story line along with adventurous action and it was hilarious. The writers really hit it out of the park with the comedy in this movie it was awesome! Definitely go check it out!</h4>
